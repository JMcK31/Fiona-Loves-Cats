              <p>Darwin is a tabby cat.  Sometimes Darwin is cuddly and sometimes he is Fiesty.  Darwin and Mabel are best friends.  Mabel is a big furry oaf who is always hungry.<p>
              <p>Mabel and Darwin met last year.  At first they were unsure of each other.  Mabel was curious and Darwin was frightened. It took some time, but eventually they grew acustomed to one another.<p>
              <p>Now they are friends!<p>
